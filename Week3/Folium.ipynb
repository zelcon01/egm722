    "# creating interactive maps with folium and geopandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In last week's practical, we saw how we can use `cartopy` to create static maps. In the first exercise from this week, we saw how we can use `geopandas` together with `shapely` to work with vector geometries. In this exercise, we'll see how we can use `geopandas`, together with `folium`, to easily create interactive maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `geopandas` to convert csv data with geographic information into vector data\n",
    "- Use `geopandas.GeoDataFrame.explore()` to create an interactive map from vector data\n",
    "- Use `pandas.DataFrame.merge()` to join attribute tables based on shared field values\n",
    "\n",
    "## data provided\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data\\_files folder, you should have the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Airports.csv, a csv file with information about Airport locations in Northern Ireland\n",
    "- NI_Wards.shp, a shapefile of electoral wards for Northern Ireland\n",
    "- transport_data.csv, a csv file with information about public transport for the electoral wards\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I will not go over the steps in detail, but if you would like to see how I created the `transport_data.csv` file, the script can be found at **data\\_files/aggregate\\_data.py**. To run that script, you will need to download the following files into the **data\\_files** folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `09-05-2022busstop-list.geojson`, a Geographic JavaScript Object Notation (GeoJSON) file containing locations for all bus stops in Northern Ireland (valid as of May 2022), from [OpenDataNI](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/@translink/translink-bus-stop-list)\n",
    "- `translink-stations-ni.geojson`, a GeoJSON file containing the locations of all Bus and Rail stations in Northern Ireland, from [OpenDataNI](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/@translink/translink-ni-railways-stations)\n",
