    "## overview\n",
    "Up to now, you have gained some experience working with basic features of python, used cartopy and matplotlib to create a map, explored using shapely and geopandas to work with vector data, and explored using rasterio and numpy to work with raster data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll see how we can use an application programming interface (API) to query and download Sentinel data, using the [SentinelSat](https://sentinelsat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) API. As part of this, we'll also introduce a few more geometric operations using `shapely` that you may find useful.\n",

    "## objectives\n",

    "In this example, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Use `shapely` to get the _unary union_ of a collection of shapes\n",
    "-  Use `shapely` to find the minimum bounding rectangle of a geometry\n",
    "-  Use the SentinelAPI to search for Sentinel-2 images\n",
    "-  Calculate the fractional overlap between shapes\n",
    "-  Use the SentinelAPI to download images\n",
