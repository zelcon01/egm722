    "As we discussed in this week's lecture, programming is a powerful tool that allows us to do complicated calculations and analysis, visualize data, and automate workflows to ensure consistency, accuracy, and reproducability in our research. In this practical, you will learn and practice basic commands in python and import modules to complete more complicated tasks. In the weeks to come, you will learn to work with different GIS datasets such as vector (e.g., shapefiles) or raster files using python libraries.\n",
